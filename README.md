# 3D-Modeling
A few examples of 3D models I have created (.blend files) and renders of those models.

I started playing around with 3D modeling in 2012, most of these models are from around that time as my current modeling work tends to be for use in games which means they are generally more basic.

I don't claim to be an expert, but for the sake of completeness I've put these here along side the more recent video game work to show that I do believe I have a solid base of knowledge in this area.

A couple of things I need to work on: animation and texturing. I believe I have the basics down in each, but I certainly have plenty of room to grow.

I've included images of each model as well as the original .blend files for use in Blender (which is free to use).
